# :iphone: Product Brief

## Problem Statement
Police officers require a lot of information and context to do their jobs. For any given response to a call for service, there is policy, procedure, and legislation that govern what police officers can and should do, and case law that provides additional context for the circumstances. 

The [status quo](http://127.0.0.1:5500/docs/#/./users?id=status-quo-experience) for locating and navigating that information is disparate, challenging, time consuming and relies heavily on individual officers' motivation and memory. The difficulty in locating relevant information [negatively impacts officer morale](http://127.0.0.1:5500/docs/#/./researchbrief?id=impact-on-morale) and introduces organizational risk.

## Goal
Equip frontline police officers with the information they need, when they need it, so that they might provide a more effective public service.

## Value Proposition
The value in addressing this problem is supported by existing organizational attempts and investments in ad-hoc solutions:

*To be completed*

## Bets/Expected Outcomes

## Differentiators
This product will differentiate itself from [existing products](http://127.0.0.1:5500/docs/#/./competitiveresearch) through:

- **User experience**. An experience designed according to officer's workflow, rather than document or content type. Existing systems require that police officers locate navigate through information based on its structure, rather than the relevance - for example, to find what policy governs responding to incidents of relationship violence, RCMP officers have to first locate where National policy is stored and locate the policy on Violence/Abuse in Relationships, and then go to a separate Divisional policy manual to find the equivalent divisional policy. The future state for this application will equip officers' based on their circumstances by surfacing *all* content, regardless of type, related to the situation they are dealing with.

- **User interface design**. Policing systems are typically either outdated with complex UIs, cumbersome enterprise systems with overwhelming UIs, or both. Ease of use and adoption will be supported through excellent UI design that is accessible and fits users' existing mental models.

- **One point of access**. Rather than searching a number of distinct locations based on the type of information, members will be able to surface all the content they might need in one location.

And by being:

- **Available**. The nature of policing an entire province means that police are required to respond to the public in areas without cellular or radio service. A core tenant of this application is to enable as much content as possible to be available to officers, regardless of their ability to be connected to a network at any given moment.

- **Open source**. One of the ten Canadian government digital principles is to [work in the open](https://open.canada.ca/en/blog/digital-principles#:~:text=focused%20on%20users.-,Work%20in%20the%20open,-Share%20and%20collaborate). Where possible, the code to create the application will be offered open source and documented, allowing police agencies across Canada to build off and customize what has been created.
 
- **Sustainable**. Using electronic original data sources and programming capabilities will allow this application to operate sustainably, free of human intervention and concerns of outdated content.
