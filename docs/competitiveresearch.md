# :trophy: Competitive research
Internal and external products tackling aspects of the same business problem - making relevant and necessary information more accessible to frontline police officers.

## Internal tools

### Traffic Enforcement Reference Manual (T.E.R.M.)
A physical and electronic document created by [two former police officers](https://termpublications.com/) that summarizes traffic legislation, fine tables, definitions, and workflows. Procured annually by the RCMP and municipal police agencies.

**Strengths:** An improvement over reading through all of the legislation.

**Weaknesses:** Published on annual basis and easily outdated; manually updated and created and prone to human error; expensive (>$25,000) contract; format (PDF or hardcopy) cumbersome for search and navigation.

### "Cheat Sheets"
Word or PDF documents that summarize procedures or workflows for officers. Typically seen for highly procedural calls, such as break & enters, impaired driving, mental health calls, and domestic offences.

**Strengths:** Often created by users themselves; easily accessible.

**Weaknesses:** Easily outdated; many versions.

## External applications

### Shield Basic British Columbia
A mobile application developed by an Ontario Provincial Police member. Confirmed use by some members in B.C. law enforcement. 

**Strengths:** Has all content; attempts to include policy. 

**Weaknesses:** Links to external content rather than a true mobile application experience; based on user navigating; user interface design; search.
