# :tropical_fish: Project Nemo

A documentation space for the BC RCMP Hub's frontline officer mobile application.

### Vision
A frontline police force...

:rotating_light: Who are equipped with the knowledge required to respond to public calls for service

:iphone: With equal access to this information, regardless of level of experience or location

:couple: Where problem-solving, conflict-resolution, and compassion are the highest-valued skills among officers

:earth_americas: And British Columbians feel protected and cared for during their interactions with police.

### Problem
An significant amount of legislation, policy, procedure, and case law governs how police officers should respond to calls for service from the public. Police officers must either rely on memory to recall what to do or otherwise find that information by navigating disparate and cumbersome systems. At best, this means that a significant amount of officers' time is spent trying to understand what they are required to do, detracting from actual public safety work, and at worst, the reliance on individual memory introduces high degree of risk to the organization from inequipped police officers. 

### Solution
A mobile application that equips frontline officers to easily locate and understand information relevant to the situation they are dealing with.

### Current stage
<mark>**MVP development.**</mark> A minimimum set of features to validate the concept value is currently in development.
