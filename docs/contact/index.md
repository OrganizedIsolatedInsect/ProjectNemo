# About...

### ...the team
We are a multidisciplinary team  made up of a product manager, designer, developers, and data resources (data scientist, engineer, and administrator). We aim to work in an agile manner, delivering value to users in frequent increments and learning through short feedback loops. Our work is prioritized based on a balance of user and organizational value, and we follow an approximation of Scrum to get the work done.

### ...the project name
Truth be told, we can't totally remember how "Finding Nemo" came about, but we are pretty sure it has to do with the app goal being searching/finding information and the parallels to the search for Nemo in [Disney's Finding Nemo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finding_Nemo)? Or maybe it had to do with the animals on the front cover of the [Traffic Enforcement Reference Manual](http://127.0.0.1:5500/docs/#/./competitiveresearch?id=traffic-enforcement-reference-manual-term). Regardless, it's stuck, and our internal working title is Project Nemo. A formal application name is yet to be determined.
