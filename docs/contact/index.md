# About...

### ...the team
We are a multidisciplinary team  made up of a product manager, designer, developers, and data resources (data scientist, engineer, and administrator) when required. We aim to work in an agile manner, delivering value to users in frequent increments. We follow an approximation of scrum to get the work done.

### ...the project name
Truth be told, we can't totally remember how "Finding Nemo" came about, but we are pretty sure it has to do with the app goal being searching/finding information and the search for Nemo? Or maybe it was the animals on the front cover of the Traffic Enforcement Reference Manual. Regardless, it's stuck, and our internal working title is Project Nemo. A formal application name is undecided.
