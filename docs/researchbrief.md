# :newspaper: Research Brief
## What we've done
- **Product manager and developer ridealongs at Langley RCMP detachment**. To ensure the product team had a shared framework for the public-facing part of frontline policing, every member of the team went on a ridealong with Langley RCMP. Each person spent at least four hours in a patrol car getting exposure to the process of responding to calls-for-service, from initial respond and dispatch to data-entry in operational systems. 
- **Product manager and data scientist 3-day site visit at Sunshine Coast RCMP detachment**. Both completed one ride-along shift and interviewed eight detachment staff. The smaller detachment sized allowed for comparison between the experience at a smaller detachment versus a larger (Langley) one, as well as exposure to all the supporting functions that go into frontline service deliver.
- **Product manager block (four shift) ride-along at Dawson Creek RCMP detachment**. The product manager spent two dayshifts and two nightshifts riding along with the same member at Dawson Creek RCMP detachment.

## Takeaways
#### The biggest opportunity to bring value to frontline operations is equipping them with an effective way to access and surface the information needed at a given time
Frontline officers spend a significant amount of time searching for information. As part of their work, they need to be aware of a massive volume of RCMP policies and procedures as well as federal, provincial, and municipal laws and regulations. Patrol officers spend time searching various information repositories, including the RCMP's intranet, consulting "cheat sheets" or resource documents, or calling colleagues to inquire what they know. Information is not available to officers in a centralized access point, nor is it designed in a way that makes it easy to access what is needed. Examples:
- Dawson Creek members had no idea about at least four RCMP tools that were available to them
- Dawson Creek members had no one to ask questions of for more complex investigative strategies - which has an impact on investigations

#### Impact on morale
Officers frequently expressed that they expected the risk and danger when they signed up for their jobs, but what they didn't expect/sign up for was the unending paperwork and processes:
- "I have no problems running into a house with a guy with a gun who wants to kill police, but this paperwork is what I hate"
- "The RCMP is so focused on PTSD, but it's not the calls that are wearing us down. It's the bullshit processes."

#### The onus is on officers to address the gaps in their needs
During user research, officers gave numerous examples of types of solutions they created or other officers created that they used to overcome:
- Managing and communicating about overtime shift opportunities through a multiple-city WhatsApp group
- Managing court schedule in a paper binder (no access to the court scheduling system)
- Keeping an Excel log of the warrants they've written because otherwise they can't find them back
- Multiple cheat sheets (how to update/maintain availability status while on the road, domestic violence flow chart, in custody bail hearing practices)
- Flow chart for members to identify legal + illegal relationships

#### Design (user interface & experience) is integral to system adoption and use
Officers repeatedly referenced how they avoided using system that were cumbersome and challenging to navigate:
- "We try not to use [system]. Our shifts change so often at a small detachment, and it's too much of a pain to adjust them every time, so we just try not to use it"
- On entering acting pay claims: "Half the time you just give up... I guess I didn't need that $10"
- "[Corporal] has a dayplanner for managing vacation, old watch commander used a calendar. We had this old shift scheduler that we could use the whole detachment - we kept using it for a long time even after [new system] was introduced".
- On the new version release of a system: "They didn't make [it] any easier to use, they just changed how it looks!"
- "I don't know where the border is, so I just make it wherever"
