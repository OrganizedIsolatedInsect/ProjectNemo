## Audience
Approximately ~3,000 RCMP frontline ("General Duty" or "patrol") officers working in British Columbia who respond to calls for service from the public. This represents ~42% of all RCMP officers in B.C, but skews toward younger and less experienced police officers.

## Operating Context
**Reactive policing**. Frontline police officers are the uniformed police officers responsible for responding to calls for service from the public (e.g. 9-1-1 calls or non-emergency calls). This is different from proactive policing, where investigators have a mandate for identifying and prosecuting specific crime types (e.g. a property crime unit, or the Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit of British Columbia, who are responsible for investigating and disrupting gang crime). The vast majority of the public only ever interact with frontline officers, meaning they have an oversized impact on shaping public perception.

Depending on the size of the detachment, job duties can vary. At larger detachments, officers are only responsible for the initial public response, and investigative work is passed off to specialized units. At smaller detachments, a frontline officer can be responsible for the investigation and administration of a call from original response all the way through its conclusion.

**Various police functions**. Frontline policing in the RCMP has two business lines: municipal and provincial. Municipal policing takes place in communities of 15,000 people or more, while the province funds policing in communities smaller than that. These business lines have different funding sources, and their priorities are influenced by different stakeholders: for municipalities, the local government has input, while provincial policing is overseen by the provincial government. 

**Geographical/demographic differences**. RCMP frontline officers police a wide range of jurisdictions. Populations range in size from very small to nearly 600,000 people, and the geography ranges from very densely populated and urban to sparsely populated with minimal cell service, or only access by plane.

**Increasing complexity of policework**. [Research](https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/lbrr/archives/cnmcs-plcng/cn000042150791-eng.pdf) has identified a massive increase in procedural steps required for specific types of investigations: 22% increase for break and enters, 25% for homicides, 45% for impaired driving, and 61% for domestic assault/intimate partner violence. The burden on police officers to fulfill each of the required steps over a large range of possible circumstances is overwhelming.
