## Branching

When working on the project in VS Code, make sure you are working from a branch separate from the master branch.
Open the Command Palette (SHIFT+CTRL+P) and search for "Branch" and it should return "Git: Create Branch..."
Once you have named your branch, it should say the branch name in the bottom left corner (branch indicator) instead of 'master'.
